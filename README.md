# Gameplay
The game starts out with the user having zero samosas. When the user clicks the Big Samosa, it initially produces one samosa per click. Then,

When the user has 10 samosas, they can buy a Double Stuffed upgrade, which produces double the amount of samosas per click.
When the user has 100 samosas, they can buy the Party Pack upgrade, which produces 5x the amount of samosas per click.
When the user has 1000 samosas, they can buy the Full Feast upgrade, which produces 10x the amount of samosas per click.
The game continues on forever and the user can continue to gain gigantic amounts of samosas. Yum!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
